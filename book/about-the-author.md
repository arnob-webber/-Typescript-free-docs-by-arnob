Hi, I’m Arnob.

i’m a 23-year-old web developer and the creator of this project. I’ve spent my career working as a Backend Engineer at companies like Origin IT and Raj IT, focusing on the technical side of how websites work.

This ebook is a fun project for me. I wanted to share something with people that might be helpful for them in their own journey. We are living in the AI era now, but I still believe there are core concepts that everyone must know to truly succeed.

I hope you find something here that helps you grow. My goal is to keep building things that make a positive impact, one project at a time.
